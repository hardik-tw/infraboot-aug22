# Kanban Board

Application GitHub Repo Link: https://github.com/swarajspatil158/to-do-app

### Problem Statement:
One of the thoughtworks internal team is working on an internal devOps project to create necessary infrastructure for one of the internal applications. 
They are following the kanban methodology and need a highly available kanban board for managing their work. 
They have decided to use this open source application. 
They need help to host this kanban board application on cloud so that it can be easily accessible by anyone in the team from the thoughtworks network.

### Ask:
Containerize this application and deploy it in the EKS cluster on AWS.

### Acceptance Criteria:
A highly available and containerized kanban board application, deployed inside the EKS cluster, should be accessible through any browser within the thoughtworks network.

### Stretched Goal:
Create build and deployment pipelines using any CI/CD tool to build this application and automatically deploy it in the EKS cluster.
